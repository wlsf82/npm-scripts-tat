This repository contains a number of defined npm scripts. These scripts can be used to automate various tasks related to building, testing, and deploying the project.

Default scripts, such as `test` and `start`, can be called with a shortcut using the command "`npm test`" and `npm start` respectively. These scripts are automatically recognized by npm and do not require the `run` command. Additionally, the `test` script can also be called with an even shorter version which is `npm t`.

The repository also contains non-default scripts, such as `build` and `deploy`, which need to be called with the command `npm run script-name`. These scripts are not recognized by npm by default and require the `run` command to execute.

Some scripts in the repository also call pre-defined scripts in order to perform multiple tasks at once. For example, the `start:and:test` script calls both the `start` and `test` scripts in succession by using the command `npm start && npm test`.

Finally, the repository also includes pre and post scripts, such as `pretest`, `posttest`, `postbuild`, `postdeploy`, etc. These scripts are executed before or after the main script and can be used for tasks such as running linting or cleaning up files. For example, the `pretest` script runs before the `test` script and can be used to check for missing dependencies before running the tests.
